title: You could have today instead you choose tomorrow 
---

the perfect Saturday involves getting up early. Not disgustingly early, just early enough that the morning is still fresh and young.

It’s our day. Not anyone else’s. There’s no purpose to it. No real structure. And everything we do is by choice. No frenzy. No rush. No imposition. Just presence and peace.

Callie Oettinger put it well:
You don’t have to do a lot every day, but you have to do something

Something. Every day.
So what is that something?
When you know what that something is, suddenly you have power and clarity and control. You know what to say yes to. What to say no to. You know who you are and what your life needs to be built around.

Vacations are not real. They cost money. Life can’t be filled with the day of your greatest, most impressive accomplishment either.

What we need is something sustainable. Something balanced. Something deliberate without being forced. I’ve always found it’s better to think about what I want my ordinary life to look like most of the time

I’m a firm believer that how long we live is outside of our control. I don’t feel comfortable trading the present for an uncertain future. “You could be good today,” the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius wrote. “But instead you choose tomorrow.” That quote haunts me as much as it inspires me. And it does a lot of each.

The poet Heraclitus said, “One day is equal to every day.” Today could be that amazing day for you. Today could be how you want life to be. You just have to choose for it to be. Or rather, stop choosing for it not to be.
